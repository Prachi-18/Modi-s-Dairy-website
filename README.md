# Modi-s-Dairy-website
Name: Prachi Modi

# Project Overview
I am developing an e-commerce website for Modi's Dairy farm

# Setup
The website has been developed using Express.js, Node.js, CSS, and HTML.
I implemented the User Authentication using PassportJs, and used MongoDB to store the user data, product data, and payment data
I used Razorpay as the payment gateway.
For security, currently I have implemented CSRFToken, but I am still looking into other options

# Challenges
The biggest challenge I faced was how to effectively end a session. Another challenge I faced was incorporating the payment gateway into my application
